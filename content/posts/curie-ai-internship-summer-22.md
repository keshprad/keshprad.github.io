Curie AI is a tech-enabled respiratory care company providing virtual personalized disease management through proprietary AI that passively detects symptoms. This approach results in high adherence, reduction in adverse events, cost savings, and improving the overall quality of life for people with chronic respiratory conditions.

During my SWE internship with Curie, I worked remotely from San Jose. Since many people on the team are located nearby in the Bay Area, I got to meet and bond with a lot of the team over a team lunch: something I’ve come to appreciate after being in complete lockdown last summer. On a daily basis, I worked on backend engineering tasks. This is my first professional experience with backend engineering; previously, I only worked on backend development through personal projects. This internship helped me understand how it would be to do backend development full-time.

Throughout my internship, I worked on projects related to EHR integrations with Curie. Specifically, I worked on a wrapper API, and data transformer. It took a while to understand how this would fit into the product as a whole, and why EHR integrations add value to Curie’s services; however, I found that after truly understanding this, I found more meaning in my work and worked more efficiently. If I were to redo this internship, I would spend more time trying to understand the significance of my project before starting to develop.

As I developed, I learned about many technologies I had never used before: I learned about the dependency injection design pattern in which objects, functions, or other data are _received_ by functions that need them, rather than created or requested; I learned how JWTs can be used for authentication; I learned about deploying and scaling a service with Docker and Kubernetes, and was able to successfully deploy the services I built on AWS. The list goes on...

Further, the internship had an immense effect on my personal growth. As I met some of the team members, I received helpful advice on my goals and designing my education. One recommendation, to read _Atomic Habits_, has armed me with a set of tools for sticking to good habits and avoiding bad ones, even helping me start this blog.

As I ended my internship, I presented the microservices I built, the motivation behind them, and how they can be used in the future at Curie. This gave me a clearer image of how the microservices I built could be used at Curie in the future. Overall, my internship at Curie was a good learning experience, as well as a chance to contribute to the organization. Reflecting on my internship, I’m content with my growth this summer, the new connections I’ve made, and the skills I’ve learned.
