Curie provides remote patient monitoring for respiratory symptoms, including detecting signs of asthma and COPD. Curie monitors a patient’s breathing as they sleep, uses artificial intelligence to produce insights on the patient’s respiratory health, then provides these insights to the patient’s clinicians.

During my SWE internship with Curie, I worked remotely from San Jose. Since many people on the team are located nearby in the Bay, I got to meet and bond with a lot of the team over a team lunch: something I’ve come to appreciate after being in complete lockdown last summer. On a daily basis, I worked on backend engineering tasks. This is my first professional experience with backend engineering; previously, I only worked on backend development through personal projects. This internship helped me understand how it would be to do backend development full-time.

Throughout my internship, I worked on projects related to EHR integrations with Curie. Specifically, I worked on a wrapper API, and data transformer. As I developed, I learned about many technologies I had never used before: I learned about dependency injection design pattern in which objects, functions, or other data are _received_ by functions that need them, rather than created or requested; I learned how JWTs can be used for authentication; I learned about deploying and scaling a service with Docker and Kubernetes, and was able to successfully deploy the services I built on AWS. The list goes on…

As I ended my internship, I presented the microservices I built, the motivation behind them, and how they can be used in the future at Curie. This gave me a clearer image of how the microservices I built fit together to help Curie integrate EMR/EHR records.

Overall, my internship at Curie was a good learning experience, as well as a chance to contribute to the organization. Further, the internship had an immense effect on my personal growth. As I met some of the team members, I was recommended to read _Atomic Habits_, which armed me with a set of tools for sticking to good habits and avoiding bad ones; it even helped me start this blog. Reflecting on my internship, I’m content with my growth this summer, the new connections I’ve made, and the skills I’ve learned.
