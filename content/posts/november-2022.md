Hi! This is my first reflection! Personally, I want to practice my writing more, so I can be more expressive of my thoughts. Specifically, the purpose of these monthly reflections is to practice introspection and retrospection.

This month was a real ride. To start off the month, I fell terribly sick. What started with a headache quickly grew to a high fever, swollen throat, and a terrible cough. I had a viral infection (not covid apparently!) and experienced severe effects for about two weeks. There were times when the pain was excruciating, and those two weeks felt neverending!

The experience of being sick for so long made me realize the struggle it has been to travel cross-country for college. In California, I always had loving parents and an older sister right beside me, and it has been hard to adjust to being away from them in college. The entire time I was sick, I imagined what it would have been like to have attended college in California: my parents would have picked me up and taken care of me. I really started to appreciate all my parents did for me as I grew up, and I also realized how difficult it is to be independent.

All the while, I had upcoming midterms. I was fortunate enough to be feeling better and didn’t need to call in sick for my exams; however while battling this viral infection, I had to power through and prepare for my exams. But my exams are over now, and I made it! _(Don’t talk to me about finals :/)_

My birthday was also on the 14th, but, at this point, I was still feeling a bit under the weather. We stayed in and my friends ordered me Blaze Pizza and we watched tv together. It was fun to have a chill night, and I was thrilled that my friends wanted to celebrate me, even if I wasn’t feeling so great at the time. By Friday, I was feeling much better and I went out with a couple friends. I didn’t set expectations for the night; I went out with the sole intent of having a good time with my friends and that’s what happened. We also went to a party at a mutual friend's apartment and met lots of people.

Finally, as Thanksgiving break approached, all of my friends left campus early to spend the week with their families. I thought I’d enjoy the time alone, and use the time to reflect, relax, and recuperate; however, I started feeling intense loneliness and asked my uncle to come pick me up early. _Loneliness_: that’s something I fear. Reflecting on this moment reminds me of how I felt when I first got to college. It took me a couple weeks, maybe a month even, before I found my friend group. That entire month I would FaceTime my family multiple times a day. I felt isolated.

I ended up staying with my relatives for a week. They live relatively close to UMD and it's been great spending time with relatives I’d hardly had the chance to meet back in California. They have much younger kids, so it’s also fun to spend time playing with them.

Reflecting on this month, I’m happy with the experiences I had. This month was certainly difficult for me, but with perseverance, it actually ended quite well. Looking ahead, I am excited to go back home in a few weeks. My sister has also planned to be back in California during my break, so I’ll get to see everyone: my parents, my sister, my high school friends, and my parents’ friends. I’m excited to be back in the community that raised me.
